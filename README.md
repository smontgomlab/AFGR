# African Functional Genomics Resource (AFGR)
The African Functional Genomics Resource includes RNA-seq, expression QTLs (eQTLs), and splicing QTLs (sQTLs) on all 593 individuals, and ATAC-seq and chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) on a representative 100 individual subset. The populations and their numbers are represented in the map below. eQTLs are defined as `SNP`-`transcript` pairs; sQTLs are `SNP`-`splice junction` pairs; caQTLs are `SNP`-`chromatin region` pairs.
